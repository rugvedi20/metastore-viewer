# AWS IAM Role Setup Images

This directory contains SVG images for the step-by-step AWS IAM role setup process shown in the application.

For production use, replace these placeholder SVG images with actual screenshots of the AWS IAM Console interface showing the exact steps to create an IAM role with appropriate S3 access permissions.

Required images:
- step1.svg - Navigate to IAM console

- step3.svg - Choose AWS account and Another AWS account
- step5.svg - Search and attach the AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess policy
- step6.svg - Add Role Name and Description
- step7.svg - Select the newly created role
- step8.svg - Go to Trust Relationships and click Edit Policy
- step10.svg - Updated Trust Policy confirmation

Note: Currently missing steps (4, 9) don't require images as they contain text instructions or code blocks to copy.
